# **Proyect Swag Labs with Playwright and TypeScript**

In this project, the **Swag Labs** website was automated using **Playwright** and **TypeScript**, applying the **Page Oject Model (POM)** design pattern to improve the maintainbility and scalability of the test code. Swag Labs is a ficticious online store used for automation testing and software testing skills development.

Project Goals: 
1. Test Automation: The primary goal was to automate key workflows on the Swag Labs website to ensure the critical functionalities work correctly.

2. Playwright Usage: Playwright was used to interact with web page elements, as it provides a robust API for handling browsers like Chromium, Firefox and Webkit. Additionally, Playwright offers advanced features such as screenshots capture, video recording, and simulating complex interactions with the page

3. TypeScript Implementation: Automation was developed using TypeScript to take advantage of static typing, improving readability and early error detection.

4. POM Pattern: The Page Object Model (POM) pattern was used to structure the tests efficiently and modularly. This pattern promotes the creation of classes representing pages of sections of the application, encapsuling the logic for interacting with the user interface elements. It makes code reuse easier and simplifies maintenance since changes to the UI only require updates to the corresponding page object classes, rather than updating all test scripts.
